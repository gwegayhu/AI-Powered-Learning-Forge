Let me break this down with clear examples:\n\n**Supervised Learning** uses labeled training data (input-output pairs):\n- Example: Email spam detection - you train on emails labeled as 'spam' or 'not spam'\n- The algorithm learns patterns to predict labels for new emails\n\n**Unsupervised Learning** finds patterns in data without labels:\n- Example: Customer segmentation - analyzing purchase behavior to group customers, without knowing the groups beforehand\n- The algorithm discovers hidden patterns or clusters\n\nThink of supervised learning like studying with answer keys, while unsupervised learning is like exploring data to find surprises!

This is how AlphaGo mastered Go and how autonomous cars learn to drive safely. It's particularly powerful for sequential decision-making problems."

Object mutations:**\n```javascript\n❌ Avoid:\nstateObject.property = newValue;\n\n✅ Use spread operator:\nsetStateObject({...stateObject, property: newValue});\n```\n\n**3. Check your state updates:**\n- Are you using the correct setter function?\n- Is the component where you expect the re-render to happen actually using that state?\n\nCan you share your component code? I can help identify the specific issue!"
