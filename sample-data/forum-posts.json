What were your biggest 'aha' moments?",

    "content": "I'm working through the React hooks module and I'm confused about useEffect dependencies. Sometimes the component re-renders infinitely, sometimes it doesn't update when I expect it to.\n\nCan someone explain the dependency array in simple terms? When should it be empty vs when should I include variables?\n\nHere's my code that's causing issues:\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchUserData();\n}, [user]);\n```",

        "content": "Great question Alexandra! The dependency array tells React when to re-run the effect:\n\n- `[]` (empty): Run once after initial render\n- `[user]`: Run when 'user' changes\n- No array: Run after every render (usually not what you want)\n\nYour code looks correct if you want to fetch data when the user changes. The infinite loop usually happens when you modify state inside useEffect without proper dependencies. Are you updating 'user' inside fetchUserData()?",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Market adoption** - Figma has rapidly become the industry standard\n2. **Collaboration** - Real-time collaboration is game-changing for teams\n3. **Web-based** - Works on any platform, no software installation needed\n4. **Community** - Huge library of plugins and resources\n\nThat said, the core UX principles are the same regardless of tool. Master the thinking, and you can adapt to any software!",
